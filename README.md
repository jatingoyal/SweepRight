# SweepRight
A Swachh Bharat android app for Microsoft Code.Fun.Do @IIT Guwahati by Team **DusticeLeague**.

This is a platform for people from different communities to spread awareness about each Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, such as 
Cleaniness Drives, Meetings etc.
But what makes the app unique is the concept of points. Registered users have to volunteer and earn a threshold amount of 
points which they can use to call for drives at their at their own localities. This encourage people to participate more
in other drives so that they can use the platform to get more participation when they organise their own drives. This creates
a continuous cycle for a good cause.
Initially, selected users are given enough points to call drives and kickstart the platform. 

Watch the demo video on Youtube [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bBoQX9DzD0)

## How to use?
- Install the apk on an android phone.
- Register and then Login to the dashboard. (Use only the Demo users mentioned below)
- Use "Vounteer in Drive" button to browse upcoming drives. Select a drive and press "Volunteer" to register.
- Ideally on the day of the drive, the person who hosted the drive will approve your presence and you will be rewarded
  with 200 points.
- Use "Call for a Drive" button to call a drive by giving a drive name and address. (Each call costs 1000 points)
- To approve participants of your drive and close the drive use "My Drive".

Two demo users have already been created. 
- User2 codefundo (1200 points)
- User1- jatin (800 points)

Password checker has been disabled for ease of demo, so use any non-empty string.

## Functionality Limitations
Due to lack of time and working knowledge this app is in a very nascent stage. The main aim of the demo app is to showcase the
core idea and purpose.
- Currently the app is entirely local. It is not yet attached to a online backend database like mySQL on Azure.
- Intended automatic drive attendance point distribution system using location services like Google Maps.
- Intended automatic system generated drives in case their are no user created drives in existence.
- Login using Microsoft, Facebook and Google accounts.
